    "text": "This package implements a variant of the “No-U-Turn Sampler” of Hoffmann and Gelman (2014), as described in Betancourt (2017). In order to make the best use of this package, you should read at least the latter paper thoroughly.This package is mainly useful for Bayesian inference. To make the best use of it, you need to be familiar with the conceptual building blocks of Bayesian inference, most importantly, you should be able to code a posterior function in Julia. For various techniques and a discussion of MCMC methods, you may the Stan Modeling Language manual helpful. If you are unfamiliar with Bayesian methods, Bayesian Data Analysis is a good introduction, among other great books.The package aims to “do one thing and do it well”: given a log density functionell mathbbR^k to mathbbRfor which you have values ell(x) and the gradient nabla ell(x), it samples values from a densityp(x) propto exp(ell(x))using the algorithm above.The package provides a framework to tune the algorithm to find near-optimal parameters for sampling, and also diagnostics that are specific to the algorithm.However, following a modular approach, it does not provideDomain transformations from subsets of mathbbR^k. For that, see ContinuousTransformations.jl.\nAutomatic differentiation. Julia has a thriving AD ecosystem which should allow you to implement this. DiffWrappers.jl should automate this in a single line.\nGeneric MCMC diagnostics not specific to NUTS. See MCMCDiagnostics.jl for an implementation of hatR and effective sample size calculations."

    "title": "The density function ell: an example",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "The density function should take a single argument q, which is a vector of numbers, and return an object which provides the methods DiffResults.value and DiffResults.gradient to access ell(q) and nablaell(q), respectively.The following example implements the density function for n observations from a textBernoulli(alpha) distribution, s of which are 1. The complete example is available in tests/example.jl.It is convenient to define a structure that holds the data,struct BernoulliProblem\n    \"Total number of draws in the data.\"\n    n::Int\n    \"Number of draws =1 in the data.\"\n    s::Int\nendthen make it callable:function (problem::BernoulliProblem)(α)\n    @unpack n, s = problem        # using Parameters\n    s * log(α) + (n-s) * log(1-α) # log likelihood\nendand finally define an object with actual data:p = BernoulliProblem(100, 40)                             # original problemThe value p is a function that takes a single real number, and returns the likelihood. However, the functions in this packagetake a vector which contains elements in mathbbR, and\nreturn an object that can provide the value and the derivatives.We could implement both manually, but it is convenient to use wrappers from two packages mentioned in the introduction:pt = TransformLogLikelihood(p, bridge(ℝ, Segment(0, 1)))  # transform\npt∇ = ForwardGradientWrapper(pt, [0.0]);                  # AD using ForwardDiff.jlThen we can call the high-level function NUTS_init_tune_mcmc that initializes and tunes the sampler, and samples from it:sample, NUTS_tuned = NUTS_init_tune_mcmc(Base.Random.GLOBAL_RNG, pt∇, 1, 1000);The returned objects are the sample, which contains the draws and diagnostic information, and the tuned sampler, which we could use to continue sampling, perhaps in parallel.We obtain the posterior using the transformation and get_position:posterior = map(get_transformation(pt) ∘ get_position, sample);which is a vector of vectors. Calculate the effective sample size and NUTS-specific statistics asjulia> effective_sample_size(first.(posterior))\n323.6134099739428\n\njulia> NUTS_statistics(sample)         # NUTS-specific statistics\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo sample of length 1000\n  acceptance rate mean: 0.92, min/25%/median/75%/max: 0.26 0.87 0.97 1.0 1.0\n  termination: AdjacentTurn => 31% DoubledTurn => 69%\n  depth: 1 => 66% 2 => 34%"
